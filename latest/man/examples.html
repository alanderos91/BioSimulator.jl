The reactions in the model are</p><blockquote><div>\[A \to X\]</div><div>\[2X + Y \to 3X\]</div><div>\[X + B \to Y + D\]</div><div>\[X \to E,\]</div></blockquote><p>where <span>$A$</span>, <span>$B$</span>, and <span>$D$</span> are chemical species assumed to be constant in concentration; only <span>$X$</span> and <span>$Y$</span> vary over time.. The species <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span> act as inputs to the synthesis and conversion of <span>$X$</span>, whereas <span>$D$</span> and <span>$E$</span> are byproducts with no impact on the system. The <span>$Y$</span> species acts as a catalyst to the synthesis of <span>$X$</span> so that <span>$X$</span> is autocatalytic. Note that the last reaction can be thought of as the decay of <span>$X$</span>.</p><p>One can study the role of stochasticity in chemical reaction cascades by coupling Brusselators[<a href="man/references.html#16">16</a>]. A cascade with <span>$N$</span> steps is modeled as</p><blockquote><div>\[A \to X_{1}\]</div><div>\[2 X_{n} + Y_{n} \to 3 X_{n}; n = 1,\ldots,N\]</div><div>\[X_{n} + B \to Y_{n} + D; n = 1,\ldots,N\]</div><div>\[X_{n} \to X_{n+1}; n = 1,\ldots,N-1\]</div><div>\[X_{N} \to E,\]</div></blockquote><p>where the <span>$X_{n} \to X_{n+1}$</span> reactions effectively couple each Brusselator. The fixed point of the system is given by the concentrations of <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span>: <span>$([X_{n}], [Y_{n}]) = ([A], [A] / [B])$</span> for each <span>$n = 1,\ldots,N$</span>, which is stable for <span>$[B] &lt; [A]^{2} + 1$</span> and unstable for <span>$[B] &gt; [A]^{2} + 1$</span>. A limit cycle exists in the unstable case which propagates noise down the steps in the cascade. A deterministic model predicts asymptotic stability at the end of the cascade, but small fluctuations from the fixed point are amplified in the stochastic setting.</p><p>This example walks through an implementation of the Brusselator cascade, including conversion of deterministic rates to stochastic rates.</p><div><pre><code class="language-julia">  model = Network(&quot;Brusselator&quot;)
